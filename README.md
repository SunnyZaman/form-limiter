# form-limiter
The Form Limiter is an application developed to automatically stop accepting Google Form responses. The creator of the Form can enable two restrictions in their form: a date restriction and a max number of responses restriction. If the form passes the date of expiration, the form stops accepting responses. Or if the number of responses exceed the max number of responses, the form stops accepting responses. 
Form Limiter was created with Google App Scripting
